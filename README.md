Chameleon is a mobile app demo that is aware of the area inside your organization and is able to provide information based on that context. A number of Beacon device stickers are going to be placed in areas of interest. The mobile application will detect a nearby beacon, and based on the context will provide the user with information or a chance to interact with.
